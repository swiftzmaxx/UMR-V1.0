![UMR-removebg-preview (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55983768/188314683-e58836c9-28c8-418a-a227-ce050f0f496f.png)

UMR is just programming language made by batch file. There's not file extension. You can only write commands. Maybe in future I can make with file extension. Maybe in UMR V2.0.Enjoy :)

## When we want to write "Hello World",use this code:
```c++
printu ("Hello World")
```
When we use UMR to do math,there is not strings in bracket.
```c++
printu(2+2)
```
